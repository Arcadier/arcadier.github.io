## Introduction

This PHP SDK is an API wrapper that allows developers to integrate their PHP applications easily with Arcadier's APIs. It does the heavily lifting of building the requests and authentication for every API call

This lets you focus on **building your front-end** instead of having to worry about if you setup the backend properly with our APIs.

All you need to know is how to which parameters in each function. This is documenteted [here]().

## Requirements
* PHP 7.0.0+
* An Arcadier marketplace of [package Scale](https://www.arcadier.com/packages.html) or above (including [Enterprise](https://www.arcadier.com/enterprise/))

## Installation via Composer
You can install SDK via composer using the following command line:
```php
composer require arcadier/test-packagist-sdk
```

## ðŸ’¡ Getting Started
### Authentication
Once the SDK is installed in your directory, go to `/vendor/arcadier/test-packagist-sdk/sdk/admin_token.php` and `/vendor/arcadier/test-packagist-sdk/sdk/ApiSdk.php` and change the following variables to your marketplace's:

* `$client_id`
* `$client_secret`
* `$marketplace`
* `$protocol` is either https or http depending on your server
* `$marketplace` is your marketplace domain.

`$client_id` and `$client_secret` are found in the Account Settings of you Administrator portal.

### Trying it
In every PHP script you intend to call Arcadier's API, make sure to include the following snippet:
```php
include '../vendor/arcadier/test-packagist-sdk/sdk/ApiSdk.php';
$sdk = new ApiSdk();
```

Get your marketplace's information

**GET** **```/api/v2/marketplaces```** is mapped to `$sdk->getMarketplaceInfo();`
```php
$marketplace_info = $sdk->getMarketplaceInfo();
echo $marketplace_info;
```

Listing all items:

**GET** **```/api/v2/items```** is mapped to `$sdk->getAllItems();`
```php
$item_list = $sdk->getAllItems();
echo $item_list['Records']; //The actual array of items is in the "Records" field of the JSON response
```

Searching for an item

**POST** **```/api/v2/items```** is mapped to `$sdk->getAllItemsJsonFiltering();`
```php
$data = [
    'keywords' => 'string',
    'pagesize' => 'string',
    'Categories' =>[
        'string'
    ],
    'sellerID' => 'string'
];

$response = $sdk->getAllItemsJsonFiltering($data);
$results = $response['Records']; //The actual array of matching items is in the "Records" field of the JSON response
```

## Example Projects
* **Basic e-commerce search page**
We have built simple CMS that can be hosted on its own and has its backend connected to Arcadier's APIs using this SDK. Head over [here](https://github.com/Arcadier/sample-PHP-SDK-web-app) to find the code.
<br>
* **Request For Quotation (RFQ) Plug-In**
This Plug-In serves as sample code to demonstrate the steps to create an RFQ experience on Arcadier's marketplaces. Head over [here]() to find the code.
